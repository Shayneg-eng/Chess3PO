The procedure uses a set of three nested for loops. All three of the for loops run once, each playing a possible chess move, going back and forth between its moves and the possible moves the human opponent could make in response. Inside The innermost for loop after a move is played, that game board is given a numerical evaluation to see if that board is advantageous or not. That evaluation is put into an "evaluation list" that will be sorted through at the end. The game board is then reset to the way it was at the beginning of the procedure, and the three nested loops are then run again and again until there are no more possible moves, adding the evaluations to the "evaluation list" as they go. At the end of the procedure, after all the possible moves are made in a three move time period, the "evaluation list" is looked through to find the move that gives the human player the least good response. That move is then played.
